## Why?

While reading [Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Go-Idiomatic-Real-World-Programming/dp/1098139291) I needed a project to implement and practice the concepts and lessons learned.

This project is born from that need to cement the teachings and to provide a tool that I can use in my daily life.
